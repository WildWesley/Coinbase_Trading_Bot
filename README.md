# Coinbase_Trading_Bot

This is a bot that I made in the style of a stock bot I made last Summer. It pulls data for each crypto currency available for purchase and trade using the Coinbase API, one request at a time. It uses moving averages to determine what the best points to buy and sell are. To better analyze the effectiveness of the bot, it saves a graph image of each transaction to the images folder.

Ideally, the bot could be run all day and all night and make reliable, marginal gains on investments made.
