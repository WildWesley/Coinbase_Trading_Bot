# Coinbase_Trading_Bot

This is a bot that I made in the style of a stock bot I made last Summer. It pulls data for each crypto currency available for purchase and trade on Coinbase, one request at a time. It uses moving averages to determine what the best points to buy and sell are, however I'm skeptical of the effectiveness of the current algorithm in place, so I haven't put any money in the bot yet.

Ideally, the bot could be run all day and all night and make reliable, marginal gains on investments made, but I may be dreaming.
